## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing public data from Brazilian e-commerce. It includes scripts for data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), answering business questions, and a Streamlit dashboard deployment for interactive data exploration. The goal is to derive insights from Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes the E-Commerce Public Dataset from the [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) and used in course offered by [Dicoding](https://www.dicoding.com/).

## Project Structure
- `Dashboard/`: Contains `ecommerce-dashboard.py`, which generates the data analysis dashboards.\
   -- `.streamlit/`: Contains config file and image for dashboard for running in local computer \
   -- `Data/`: Contrains raw csv data files from source for running in local computer \
- `Data/`: Holds the raw CSV data files from the source for running in streamlit cloud \
- `.streamlit` : Holds config file and image for dashboard for running in streamlit cloud \
- `E-Commerce Public Dataset Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for performing data task such as wrangling, exploration, analysis, and question answering. \
- `E-Commerce Public Dataset Analysis _ID.ipynb`: Indonesian version of `notebook.ipynb`. \
- `README.md`: This documentation file. \
- `requirements.txt`: Required library to run the dashboard \
- `url.txt`: Contains url for deployed dashboard at streamlit cloud \

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or just download it.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Isaacdha/Brazilian-E-Commerce.git
    ```
    or\
    `https://github.com/Isaacdha/Brazilian-E-Commerce/archive/refs/heads/main.zip`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd data-analyst-dicoding
    ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Both dashboards (static in the form of ipynb) and dynamic (in the form of streamlit apps) already have data wrangling, data cleaning, and information search features by answering business questions.
1. **Data Wrangling**: Use either `E-Commerce Public Dataset Analysis.ipynb` file to clean and prepare the data or streamlit deployed app to directly jumps to visualization.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data using the provided scripts to uncover patterns in the e-commerce dataset.
3. **Visualization**: Use the `E-Commerce Public Dataset Analysis.ipynb` or Launch the Streamlit dashboard for interactive data exploration:
    ```sh
    cd data-analyst-dicoding/dashboard
    streamlit run dashboard.py
    ```
    Access the dashboard in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
